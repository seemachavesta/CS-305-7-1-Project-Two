Secure Software Development Project: Artemis Financial
Client Overview and Requirements
Artemis Financial is a leading financial services provider with a strong focus on secure transactions and data integrity. The company sought to address vulnerabilities in their software to ensure compliance with modern security standards and protect sensitive client data.

Addressing the Client's Needs
I identified and resolved software security vulnerabilities by implementing robust encryption algorithms, such as AES, and integrating tools like the Maven dependency-check plugin to identify and update outdated or vulnerable libraries. These steps strengthened the applicationâ€™s security posture and ensured compatibility with industry standards.

Importance of Secure Coding
Secure coding is critical for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining trust. By preventing vulnerabilities, secure software development reduces the risk of data breaches, which can have severe financial and reputational impacts on a company.

Challenges and Learnings
The vulnerability assessment was both challenging and rewarding. Ensuring dependency compatibility and mitigating risks from outdated libraries required careful analysis. However, this process deepened my understanding of dependency management and security protocols.

Enhancing Security Layers
I enhanced security by using AES encryption for data protection, performing checksum validations with SHA-256, and addressing vulnerabilities in project dependencies. These measures created multiple layers of defense against potential threats.

Future Vulnerability Assessments
In the future, I would leverage tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and static analysis tools to assess vulnerabilities. These tools, combined with a risk-based approach, will guide mitigation techniques and ensure secure coding practices.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
To verify the functionality and security of the refactored code, I conducted extensive functional and secondary testing. Post-refactoring, I ran the dependency-check report to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Tools and Practices
I utilized tools like Maven for dependency management, AES for encryption, and SHA-256 for checksum validation. Following clean code principles and industry standards ensured the application was secure, maintainable, and scalable.

Demonstrating Skills to Employers
Future employers could view this project as a testament to my ability to assess, mitigate, and prevent software vulnerabilities. It showcases my expertise in secure coding, dependency management, and testing in real-world scenarios.
